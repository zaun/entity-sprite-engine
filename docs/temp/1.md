Executive summary
You’ve built a full-featured, well-modularized engine: memory-tracked allocations, a sandboxed Lua integration, asset management (images, atlases, fonts, maps), an entity/component system, collision detection that auto-tunes and escalates to DBVH, a two-stage rendering stack (draw_list -> render_list -> renderer), and a shader compilation toolchain. The code shows attention to defensive programming (log_assert), profiling hooks, and resource ownership semantics (lua_ref counting, C vs Lua ownership). Overall architecture is solid and pragmatic.

Major strengths
- Consistent memory tagging and tracking across subsystems via memory_manager.
- Clear separation between C ownership vs Lua ownership; many components handle this carefully.
- Good use of a staging draw list and batched render list for renderer independence.
- Thoughtful collision index architecture combining grid and DBVH (adaptive).
- Extensive Lua integration with metatables, caching and sandboxing concerns addressed.
- Shader pipeline using SPIR-V + spirv-cross to target multiple platforms is robust.
- Lots of profiling instrumentation, which will help optimize hotspots.

Major risks / areas to prioritize
- Complexity in Lua engine: custom allocator + hook + stack management is correct but fragile; small stack mismanagement can crash. There are many places where stack hygiene is critical.
- Memory-manager's aligned_alloc + tracking loop: edge cases with realloc/free and backtrace tracking could produce leaks or double-free false positives if headers mismatch.
- Many ownership rules rely on lua_ref counters and manual ese_x_ref/unref calls; these need strict discipline and tests — leaks & premature frees are likely.
- Concurrency is not visible — make sure renderer / platform code call into engine APIs on an expected thread.
- Some heuristics (polyline tessellation thresholds, DBVH thresholds) are hard-coded and may need tuning.

Now the detailed subsystem reviews.

Cross-cutting foundations

Memory manager
What’s good
- Centralized allocation api with tags, tracking, report and leak detection.
- Aligned allocations, stats per tag, leak reporting on destroy.

Concerns & suggestions
- You use aligned_alloc and later free(ptr) — fine. But _hash_ptr uses (addr >> 4) & mask; if aligned differently on some platforms this is brittle. Consider using pointer hashing mixing addr bits and more entropy.
- _mm_realloc currently allocates new block via _mm_malloc then memcpy and _mm_free old. That’s okay but you call _mm_malloc which allocates header tracking — then _mm_free removes entry; fine.
- In _mm_free, if entry not found you call log_assert(0, ...) — that aborts on free of untracked pointer. That may be too harsh in release; prefer logging and continuing (but okay for debug).
- memory_manager.strdup delegates to _mm_strdup — good.
- ALLOC_TABLE_SIZE is large; good. But AllocEntry uses malloc/free (not memory_manager) — acceptable to avoid recursion.
- Ensure memory_manager.destroy() is called at final shutdown to report leaks.

Logger & profiling
- Logging and profile hooks are pervasive; good for optimization.
- Consider building a log level configuration and optionally compile out verbose debug in production.

Scripting / Lua engine

What’s good
- Custom allocator with memory_limit protects engine from runaway scripts.
- Sandbox master, explicit whitelist of safe functions.
- Custom hook for instruction/time limits.
- Function caching (per instance) and run_function_ref path to reduce lookup overhead.
- Handling of script pre-processing (colon to dot conversion) and module instance system.

Concerns & specifics
1) Stack management complexity
- lua_engine_run_function is very complex: it uses caching, manipulates stack (lua_insert, pushing self, args), then pcall. There are many places where stack balancing issues can occur. You already added extensive debug and resets — this is good. I recommend centralizing a helper that sets up call stack and guarantees cleanup (RAII-style patterns aren't available in C, but helper functions that push function+args and ensure pop on error simplify correctness).

2) cached_func_ref use & registration
- You cache function by pushing into LUA_REGISTRYINDEX keyed by "func_cache_%d_%s" string. However you then luaL_ref() the function and also previously had pushed function into registry keyed by string. Careful: you do lua_pushstring(cache_key); lua_gettable(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX); if function exists you do cached_func_ref = luaL_ref(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX) — that will pop the function and create a reference, but you haven't removed the string->function mapping; you then keep that cached ref in registry as well. On repeated calls you get additional refs. It seems you intended to store the function under the cache_key in registry (not as table entry). Simpler: after getting function, call lua_pushvalue(-1); lua_setfield(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, cache_key) OR lua_pushstring; lua_pushvalue; lua_settable. Current implementation is inconsistent and could leak registry entries or duplicate refs. I suggest choosing one (string key in registry or luaL_ref index) and use it consistently.

3) _lua_engine_instance_get_function
- Very thorough. It searches instance table, metatable __index function, __index table. Good.
- But it modifies and pops stack many times; ensure matched pops in failure paths to avoid stack leaks. You already log stack sizes — good.

4) Custom allocator and Lua GC interplay
- You prepend header for allocation size — fine. But in _lua_engine_limited_alloc you free hdr as memory_manager.free(hdr); and return. Make sure memory_manager.free expects original pointer (hdr) — you pass hdr that was allocated via memory_manager.malloc(total_size). But when ptr passed to free comes as pointer to user memory (hdr+sizeof), you compute old_hdr pointer = ptr - sizeof(LuaAllocHdr) — OK.
- Potential issue: when ptr == NULL && nsize == 0: you handle free path; ensure osize not used; okay.

5) Preprocessing colon operator replacement
- _replace_colon_calls is complex; be careful: your algorithm may change function definitions incorrectly in edge cases. Unit test thoroughly.

6) LuaJIT enablement
- You try to call jit.on but use lua_getglobal("jit") then lua_getfield("on") then lua_pcall with 0 args — not correct: calling a function requires pushing the function and its args; but you used lua_getfield then lua_pcall(0,0,0) — that will call nothing because you didn't push function? You do push function (lua_getfield pushes it) — pcall(0,0,0) calls it but pcall expects function below args; this is fine. But enabling JIT at runtime may not be portable (not present). You already guard.

7) Error handling & reporting
- On runtime errors in lua_pcall, you report to engine console. Good.

Recommendations for Lua engine
- Simplify function caching: store function ref in component->function_cache (you already do elsewhere). For engine-level caching, consider an explicit map from (instance_ref, func_name) -> ref.
- Build small unit-tests around stack manipulations (simulate failures).
- Consider using protected wrappers for common patterns: push func, push self, push args, pcall, cleanup — to avoid repeated code.

Engine core & lifecycle

What’s good
- Clean separation of phases in engine_update: input, entity updates, collision detection, draw list creation, render list generation, flip.
- Double-buffered render lists and engine->_engine_render_flip is clear.
- Entity lifecycle: creation, copy, destroy handled uniformly with Lua ownership semantics.

Concerns & suggestions
- engine_update: you call collision_index_clear and then insert all entities. collision_index_get_pairs will convert dense bins into DBVHs and remove bins from bins map by int_hashmap_remove which will call dlist_free — ensure dlist_free does not free entity pointers (you note this). Very sensitive ownership assumptions.
- Entity deletion: you append to del_entities then at end pop and call entity_destroy. Ensure no use-after-free (e.g., collision pairs or callbacks still reference entity during frame). You already clear collisions early; still need to ensure no dangling pointers in pubsub or other systems (you unsubscribe in entity_destroy).
- engine_set_renderer recreates asset manager and calls asset_manager_create_font_atlas — fine.

Asset manager

What’s good
- Grouped hashmap approach seems clean; distinct maps for sprites/textures/atlases/maps.
- Loading sprite atlas supports indexed transparency and frame UV computation.
- Font atlas creation: creates texture and sprite frames.

Issues & suggestions
1) _split_string: bug: when input has "test:" (group exists, name empty) you return early but you already set *group and *name earlier? In your code you compute groupLength and nameLength, then if nameLength == 0 { return; } but you didn't set group/name in that path — earlier you set *group and *name only in branches; for "test:" it should set group="test" and name=""? Comment says Will be set to NULL if input invalid. But returning without setting will leave *group == NULL (initialised to NULL) and *name == NULL — acceptable but maybe unexpected. Clarify semantics: recommend treat "group:" as group with default name? Document.

2) asset_manager_load_sprite_atlas: constructing texture_id allocates memory for "group:image" string then later memory_manager.free(texture_id). But grouped_hashmap_set(manager->textures, group, image, asset_texture) later stores asset_texture keyed by group/name; the texture_id used inside sprite frames is pointer to that allocated buffer; you free it before frames reference it — NO: you free texture_id right after loading atlas and creating sprites — but sprite_add_frame uses texture_id string pointer passed which you used when creating sprite frames: sprite_add_frame(sprite, texture_id, ...). The sprite stores texture_id (in sprite_add_frame you strdup the texture_id into frame->texture_id using memory_manager.strdup). Wait: in sprite_add_frame you do frame->texture_id = memory_manager.strdup(texture_id,...). So it's safe to free texture_id after creating sprites — good.

3) image_path discovery: you search extensions and use access(temp_path, F_OK) and then free temp_path only if not chosen. Good.

4) stbi_image_free vs memory_manager.free
- You load image_data via stbi_load which expects stbi_image_free, and you call stbi_image_free(image_data) correctly. For processed_data allocated via memory_manager.malloc you free via memory_manager.free.

5) Font atlas: implementation assumes font_data format (2 bytes per row etc.) — this is very custom; document expected format.

6) asset_manager_get_texture_size signature in header returns int **out_width,int **out_height — but I don't see implementation in your c file (you didn't provide). This header function should probably be int* out_width,int* out_height. Verify.

Collision index (grid + DBVH)

What’s good
- Auto-tuning of cell_size based on measured entity diagonals; adaptive behavior is excellent.
- Hybrid approach: grid for sparse, DBVH for dense 3x3 blocks — smart.
- Deduplication of collision pairs via hashmap seen + canonical key good.
- DBVH built as AVL-like balanced internal nodes — non-trivial and well-coded.

Concerns & specific issues
1) _collision_index_convert_cell_to_dbvh: you remove bins via int_hashmap_remove which returns dlist pointer and you call dlist_free on it. You claim int_hashmap_remove returns stored value and map’s freefn is dlist_free — your int_hashmap_create passed (EseIntHashMapFreeFn)dlist_free so int_hashmap_remove likely called freefn; but you still call dlist_free on removed — double-free possibility if map's remove already freed. You commented that int_hashmap_remove returns stored value but does not call free_fn — ensure implementation semantics match. Fix: make it explicit: use int_hashmap_remove_no_free or document. Otherwise double-free.

2) DBVH node memory management: _dbvh_node_destroy recursively frees children — fine.

3) _dbvh_insert: algorithm creates internal node with NULL entity and attaches left root and right new node; then balances — OK but verify height calculations correct.

4) _collision_index_emit_pair_if_new: you allocate key then call hashmap_set(seen,key,(void*)1); then memory_manager.free(key) — but comment says hashmap will own key and free later. But you free key immediately — that frees memory the hashmap will expect to own. That's a bug: you must NOT free key after hashmap_set if hashmap will free it. Your comment contradicts code. In code: hashmap_set(seen, key, (void*)1); memory_manager.free(key); This will double-free or leave invalid pointer in hashmap. Choose one: either strdup key and hashmap_take ownership (don't free), or copy key and let local free if hashmap copies key. Fix: remove memory_manager.free(key). This is critical: causes crashes.

5) _collision_index_compute_key packs signed ints into uint64 — okay.

6) collision_index_get_neighbors: neighbors array parameter is used but caller must allocate; ensure callers allocate 8 entries (3x3 minus center=8). Implementation lacks bounds check.

Engine entity & components

What’s good
- Component lifecycle abstraction with _entity_component_* modules and entity_component_update dispatch.
- Lua proxies and ownership tracking across many component types implemented consistently.
- Components support copy/create/destroy and Lua GC owner flags.

Concerns & specific bugs
1) entity_component_detect_collision_rect uses ese_rect_copy for each colliderRect and destroys each — inefficient but safe.

2) entity_component_collider_rects_remove/pop/shift: you manipulate Lua __is_lua_owned flags in a couple of ways with lua_setfield and lua_settable; ensure the correct stack indexes are used — some places do lua_settable(L,2) after pushing key and value, others use lua_setfield(L,-2,...). I saw in remove() you do:
   lua_pushstring(L, "__is_lua_owned");
   lua_pushboolean(L, true);
   lua_settable(L, 2);
That expects table at index 2 — but in some call sites the component proxy may not be at stack index 2. This is fragile. Prefer retrieving component proxy by reference or using lua_setfield with explicit index. Add unit tests for JS-style operations.

3) entity_lua_dispatch conversion of Lua args to EseLuaValue uses lua_value_from_stack which uses lua_value_create_nil on each and recurses. There are debug prints left (printf) — these should be removed or gated by debug flags.

4) Many entity lua functions push cclosures with upvalues (entity pointer), this is fine.

5) entity_component_run_function caching: earlier component code caches function refs in a hashmap — good.

Rendering pipeline: draw_list -> render_list -> renderer

What’s good
- draw_list layers: object pool, reuse objects, reduce allocations per frame.
- render_list.fill does batching by texture vs color and special handling of polylines (fill and stroke separated) — good.
- Conversions to NDC in render_list helpers, tessellation for polyline fill/stroke implemented.

Concerns & improvements
1) draw_list_object_get_bounds: many functions assume object->type set before calling; ensure draw_list_object_set_texture / set_rect_color / set_bounds ordering is enforced in callers (you sometimes set bounds first then set texture). Consider atomic setters that accept full set.

2) Tessellation & NDC conversions
- Converting stroke width by stroke_ndc = (half_width / view_w) * 2.0f is an approximation: stroke width should consider view_height as well for aspect-ratio; using screen-space lines vs NDC is tricky. Consider doing stroke geometry in pixel space, then convert vertices to NDC.

3) Polyline fill triangulation uses centroid fan; this is fine for convex polygons but can generate overlapping triangles for concave polygons (self-intersections). If you expect arbitrary polygons, consider ear-clipping triangulation or library (poly2tri) for robust tessellation. Your region detection via large jumps helps disconnected regions but not concavity.

4) Vertex formats: EseVertex stores (x,y,z,u,v) — when generating color-only batches you leave u,v zero; renderer must branch based on batch type.

5) Batching grouping by color uses equality of r,g,b,a and .filled — acceptable but might break if floats used — you use unsigned char, good.

6) render_list_clear destroys and frees all batches each frame, then render_list_fill re-creates batches as needed — this causes repeated allocations. Consider reusing batch objects and buffers (like draw_list reuses object pool) to reduce reallocs.

Shader toolchain

What’s good
- Using glslang to compile GLSL->SPIRV, then spirv-cross to target GLSL and MSL is best practice for cross-platform shader portability.
- You set many resource limits and SPIR-V options to preserve debug info.
- You include post-processing to generate missing structs for MSL output — clever.

Concerns & suggestions
1) compile_glsl_to_spirv: you call shader.setAutoMapBindings(true) and setAutoMapLocations(true) — these can change binding/layout semantics; that's often desired but document behavior vs explicit bindings in GLSL.

2) Error handling: You return errors but also print via fprintf; prefer log_error.

3) spirv_to_metal: the heuristic code to detect missing structs via regex is clever but brittle: spirv-cross normally emits needed structs. Only use these patches if necessary; ensure generated MSL compiles in real-world cases. Heavy reliance on regex over compiled AST can lead to incorrect code.

4) finalize_glslang: never called — add a shutdown hook to call finalize_glslang() in program exit.

Sprite, Tileset, Map, MapCell

Sprites
- Implementation straightforward; frames store strdup texture_id — good.

Tileset
- Weighted selection LCG RNG acceptable; consider using std::mt19937 in C++ area for better distribution.
- ese_tileset_get_sprite returns char* internal pointer (owned by tileset) — ensure caller treats as const.

Map & MapCell
- Map creates 2D arrays of mapcell pointers and owns cells: OK.
- Map resizing copies cells and deep-copies; drag: eje_map_set_cell uses ese_map_cell_copy — copies cell and uses memory_manager; good.
- MapCell userdata implementation is thorough. Watch for memory ownership: ese_map_cell_lua_push when cell->lua_ref != LUA_NOREF you do lua_rawgeti(state, ref) — ok.

Collision & physics math

Rect & OBB SAT
- Good OBB implementation and fast AABB path.
- ese_rect_contains_point uses rotation check and rotates point into local coordinates — correct.

Ray & Arc
- Ray intersection uses slab method; good.
- Arc geometry implemented. Ensure angle normalization works for wrap-around arcs; you add 2pi to end if end < start — okay.

Scripting bindings / typing

- Many metatables and push/get helpers are consistent across types, good discipline.
- Ownership: For every create that returns C-owned object you call _xxx_register(..., false) so Lua GC won't free C allocated memory. That pattern is consistent.

Potential correctness bugs & major items to fix (high priority)
1) collision_index._collision_index_emit_pair_if_new frees key after hashmap_set(seen, key, (void*)1). That will either double-free or leave dangling pointer in hashmap. Fix: remove memory_manager.free(key). (Critical: leads to crash)

2) _collision_index_convert_cell_to_dbvh: double-free risk when using int_hashmap_remove — ensure remove does not already call free_fn. Confirm int_hashmap API or change code to only free returned list and not call free_fn on removal.

3) memory_manager._mm_free: log_assert(0, "Attempting to free untracked pointer %p", ptr); Will abort process on untracked free. Consider turning this into log_error to avoid runtime aborts in release, or keep assert for debug only.

4) entity_component_* Lua interactions: multiple places assume stack index positions for setting __is_lua_owned. Some code uses lua_settable(L,2) with table at index 2; ensure those callsites always have table at index 2. Consider a helper function to set_is_lua_owned_on_stack(idx, bool).

5) lua_engine_run_function caching logic may create inconsistently referenced functions in registry (see cached_func_ref path). Refactor caching approach to avoid leaks.

6) _split_string logic: ambiguous behavior with "test:" and ":" inputs — clarify & document.

Medium-priority correctness & edge-cases
- draw_list_object_set_texture: strncpy into TEXTURE_ID_MAX_LEN; but elsewhere you store texture_id pointers into other data structures and strdup them; ensure no overflow.
- asset_manager_load_sprite_atlas: texture_id_len calculation adds +1 twice; ensure snprintf buffer sizes appropriate.
- shader toolchain: calling glslang::InitializeProcess multiple times — you guard with static flag — ensure finalize_glslang called at app teardown.

Performance opportunities
- Reuse render batches across frames instead of destroying them in render_list_clear — reduce allocations.
- Draw list: your object pool is good; ensure memory_manager.realloc growth uses exponential approach — ok.
- Collision: tuning parameters (DBVH threshold, autotune thresholds) are empirical; expose them as config values to quickly tune with different game worlds.
- Lua invocation: use run_function_ref as fast path; ensure caching is correct and persistent across frames.
- For polyline tessellation, consider a faster allocator and avoid many temporary allocations.

Security & robustness
- Lua sandboxing: you remove dofile/loadfile/require and build a master whitelist; good. But you still call luaL_openlibs(engine->runtime) before removing dangerous libs. Better approach: only open needed libraries or remove unwanted ones immediately (you do remove some). Also check package, io, os tables. You copy selected functions into sandbox_master — good.
- Custom allocator limits are good; ensure memory_used accounting is accurate in realloct scenarios.

Coding & style suggestions
- Consistent ownership documentation: each function that creates an object should have clear comment whether Lua or C owns it and who should call ref/unref.
- Centralize macros for repeated strings: metatable names etc. already done.
- Remove printf debug messages left in Lua conversion functions.
- Add unit-tests for memory leaks, allocation/free edge cases, and collision correctness.

Testing plan & instrumentation
- Add unit tests per module:
  - Memory manager: allocations, frees, realloc, leak detection, double-free behaviour.
  - Lua engine: compile and run small scripts, verify sandbox, validate timeout hook, memory limits, function lookup caching.
  - Asset manager: atlas loading, indexed transparency, font atlas ingestion, sprite retrieval.
  - Collision index: spawn many entities with varying sizes and positions to exercise grid/DBVH conversion, and assert correctness matches brute-force.
  - Render_list: add many draw objects (rect, texture, polyline) and ensure batches and vertex data are stable; verify renderer consumes expected data.
  - Tileset: weight selection distribution tests.

- Fuzzing: feed malformed JSON, atlas files, and shader sources to ensure robust error handling.

Prioritized actionable roadmap (recommended order)
1) Fix critical bug: remove memory_manager.free(key) after hashmap_set(seen, key, ...) in _collision_index_emit_pair_if_new. Add unit test for collision deduping ensuring no crash.
2) Audit int_hashmap_remove/free semantics where you manually free returned value (DBVH conversion). Ensure no double-free.
3) Simplify and correct Lua function caching flow in lua_engine_run_function. Choose single strategy for cache (string->ref in registry OR hashmap), remove duplicate ref creation, and write tests to ensure no leaks.
4) Harden lua_engine_run_function stack handling: factor pushing function/self/args into helper that guarantees cleanup, and add unit tests for stack size invariants.
5) Remove debug prints (printf) in lua conversion functions and add log_debug guards.
6) Render_list: change render_list_clear to reuse batches instead of destroying; amortize buffer allocation by keeping batches and clearing vertex_count.
7) Polyline tessellation: adopt ear-clipping or third-party tessellator for robust concave polygon fills (if polygons can be concave).
8) Add finalize_glslang() call at app shutdown to free resources.
9) Audit and document ownership conventions across all "xxx_register" and "xxx_ref/unref" functions; produce one-page ownership matrix.
10) Add a set of unit tests and CI to run them automatically (memory, Lua, collision, rendering path smoke tests).

Miscellaneous suggestions & small improvements
- Consider replacing custom LCG with std::mt19937 or platform random for tileset selection — reproducibility control (seed) is good; expose seed setter (you have ese_tileset_set_seed).
- Consider adding explicit APIs to prefetch/free assets to control memory usage.
- Document expected formats (font bitmap, atlas JSON schema) clearly in repository.
- Consider thread-safety: many global structures assume single-threaded access; document thread model. If you plan multi-threading (asset loading threads), introduce synchronization and thread-safe memory manager usage.
- Consider decoupling shader toolchain (C++ compiled) from engine build; provide CLI tool too.

Final thoughts
You’ve built a large, mature engine core with many advanced pieces: sandboxed Lua, adaptive collision, multi-platform shader pipeline, and a decent render architecture. My review found few critical correctness issues (notably the hashmap key free) and some fragility around Lua stack and ownership semantics. Address those high-priority items first, add automated tests for the collision and scripting paths, and then iterate on performance (render batch reuse, tessellation improvements). The codebase is in very good shape structurally — with careful cleanup of the few ownership/stack bugs and improved reuse pattern for render batches, this will be solid and production-ready.

If you want, I can:
- produce a prioritized patch list (diffs) for the critical fixes (collision pair key free, DBVH remove semantics, Lua caching).
- create unit-test skeletons (C tests) for collision index, memory manager, and Lua run paths.
- produce a checklist of ownership rules per type (who calls ref/unref, who frees).
Which of those would you like next?
