Below is a concise, opinionated review focused on the entity/component model and the Lua integration, followed by a security review of the Lua engine with actionable fixes.

Overall architecture and entity/component model
- Ownership and lifetime
  - Clear pattern: C objects are primary, with Lua proxy tables storing a lightuserdata pointer (__ptr), a metatable for type safety, and an __is_lua_owned flag steering GC behavior. This is good for preventing double free and for dual-ownership use cases.
  - Registration using luaL_ref and pushing back via rawgeti is consistent. You correctly unref registry entries on destroy.
  - Consistency note: Entities/components created from C use is_lua_owned=false (C-owned). Lua constructors set is_lua_owned=true. You respect this in __gc methods. Good.

- Proxy design and type safety
  - entity_lua_get and component-specific _get helpers validate the metatable before extracting __ptr. Good.
  - You store the metatable name in __name and compare when needed. Using lua_rawequal on metatables is proper type checking.
  - Using lightuserdata for the backing pointer keeps allocations minimal.

- Components API from Lua
  - components proxy exposes array-like access, count, add/remove/insert/pop/shift/find/get. This is a dev-friendly surface.
  - Ownership toggling: when a component/rect is added to a C array, you flip the proxy’s __is_lua_owned to false; when removed and returned to Lua (pop/shift), you set it to true. That aligns with your ownership model and is a strong pattern.

- Memory management and resizing
  - You resize arrays with memory_manager.realloc doubling capacities. Straightforward and efficient.
  - You consistently NULL-terminate vacated slots after removal.

- Copying
  - entity_copy deep-copies components by delegating to entity_component_copy (which branches by type). Solid.
  - For collider rectangles and sprite component, copying behavior is consistent with their data.

- Collision system
  - You use a canonical key combining two UUID hashes to track per-frame collision state and fire enter/stay/exit events. This is a practical approach.
  - The hash key uses a static char buffer: this is not thread-safe. If you ever multi-thread collisions, this will be a race. Consider using a per-call heap buffer or a thread-local buffer, or store combined keys as 128-bit/struct keys in the hashmap directly.

- Potential correctness concerns
  - entity_component_detect_collision_component casts EntityComponent* to specific subtype structs incorrectly:
    - You currently do:
      EntityComponentCollider *colliderA = (EntityComponentCollider *)a;
      but a actually points to the base struct, and the collider’s data is at a->data.
      Correct:
      EntityComponentCollider *colliderA = (EntityComponentCollider *)a->data;
      EntityComponentCollider *colliderB = (EntityComponentCollider *)b->data;
      The same issue appears elsewhere in a few places; most other call sites correctly use component->data.
  - Entity Lua dispatch returns true regardless of underlying execution result. You push boolean true at the end even if the script wasn’t found or args conversion failed. Consider returning the real status or throwing a Lua error for consistency.
  - In entity_process_collision, for “stay” you call entity_run_function_with_args(entity, "entity_collision_stay", 1, arg_b) for both a and b. For a, arg_b is a ref to entity (self), not test. Likely a bug. Consistency:
    - enter and exit: you pass arg (other). For stay, keep same convention: pass the other entity for each side.

- Minor API and ergonomics
  - For components.find(typeName) you build a metatable name using "%sProxyMeta". This is fine but couples Lua string to C naming. Consider exposing type tags directly on proxies (__type = "Collider") to decouple.
  - components.remove returns boolean; components.add returns 0. Consider normalizing these to return success or the affected object.
  - Some logging messages include strong language. Consider cleaning logs for production.

Lua integration and runtime
- Engine registry keys
  - You store pointers keyed by sentinel-address lightuserdata. That’s good (collision-proof).

- Global locking
  - You set _G’s __newindex to a C error function preventing global writes. Good sandbox step.
  - You also lock the metatable by setting a sentinel field to hinder tampering. Reasonable.

- Script model
  - Scripts are loaded via luaL_loadstring(fileContent) and must return a class table; instances are thin instance tables with metatable __index = class. That’s a common and minimal pattern.
  - You use an instruction hook and time limit for running functions. This is a strong guard.

- LuaValue conversions
  - There’s a full conversion path both directions. The table conversion uses name to decide field vs array. Reasonable for your use case.

- Potential API inconsistencies
  - lua_engine_instance_run_function returns true even if function not found (you do return false, but the wrapper in entity didn’t report it). Standardize return and log behavior.

Security review of the Lua engine
Positives
- Memory limit is enforced via a custom allocator; time and instruction limits are enforced via a hook. This mitigates runaway scripts.
- Dangerous functions (dofile, loadfile, require) removed from globals. Good.
- Global write lock via __newindex guard reduces accidental global pollution.

High/critical issues and fixes
1) Not a real sandbox: base libs still enabled and unsafe APIs exposed
   - Risk: luaopen_base exposes functions like load, loadstring, getmetatable, setmetatable, debug.getregistry access via pairs, and potentially os, io if not loaded but base still allows some reflective power. While you didn’t open io, os, debug explicitly, base includes functions like getmetatable/setmetatable/rawset/rawequal and coroutine, etc. Malicious scripts can still subvert behavior, store large objects in registries, mutate metatables, or craft slow paths.
   - Recommendation:
     - Create a minimal safe environment table for scripts with only the whitelisted functions you need.
     - Do not require or expose any of the standard libs by default. Instead, selectively expose math and string only, with sanitized subsets if needed.
     - If you must keep base, remove or wrap dangerous functions:
       - Remove or wrap: load, loadstring, dofile, loadfile, getmetatable, setmetatable, collectgarbage, coroutine API, debug API.
       - Confirm you did not load debug library; don’t require it.
     - Set a separate environment for class tables/instances (setfenv or equivalent for Lua 5.2+ via _ENV) so they don't see _G directly.

2) Instruction limit value and hook frequency
   - Current max_instruction_count is set to 4,000,000,000 with LUA_HOOK_FRQ=1000; the hook increments by LUA_HOOK_FRQ each hit. This effectively won’t trip in realistic time, which defeats the guard.
   - Recommendation:
     - Tighten max_instruction_count to a practical number, e.g., 1e6 to 1e7 for per-call, depending on your frame budget.
     - Consider smaller hook count increments (e.g., set hook every 100 instructions), balancing overhead and granularity.
     - Alternatively, count VM steps more precisely if performance allows.

3) Global environment not fully sandboxed for instances
   - Scripts run in the main state with base libs; class tables and instance tables inherit access via __index to the class table which references globals.
   - Recommendation:
     - When creating the class table result, rebind its environment to a restricted table with only whitelisted globals (e.g., math, string, your engine functions).
     - For Lua 5.2+, you can set _ENV at script load time by wrapping or using luaL_loadbuffer with an injected prologue that sets a safe environment.

4) Memory limit bypass potential
   - You enforce allocator limits via _lua_engine_limited_alloc. Good. But C native functions you expose could allocate outside the allocator (e.g., sprites, assets), indirectly enabling memory pressure.
   - Recommendation:
     - Consider per-script or per-engine quotas for asset loads triggered by Lua functions.
     - Track and limit allocations in those subsystems based on script identity if necessary.

5) Registry misuse risk
   - You store ENGINE_KEY, LUA_ENGINE_KEY, entity_list, etc., in the registry. If a script can obtain LUA_REGISTRYINDEX or debug functions, it could tamper.
   - You did not expose debug library; that’s good. Still, to be safer:
     - Keep sensitive references off the registry or store in upvalues only C can access.
     - If registry must be used, ensure scripts cannot get to it. Avoid exposing debug, and restrict load.

6) String load of scripts
   - You read files, then luaL_loadstring. This is acceptable, but it means bytecode is not used. Not necessarily a security issue but a performance note. You already validate extension .lua. That’s fine.

7) Hook data retrieval via LUA_REGISTRYINDEX key
   - You store LuaFunctionHook* via lightuserdata key LUA_HOOK_KEY. If code ever exposes this, scripts could tamper. Not currently exposed. Keep it that way.

8) Potential metatable tampering of proxies
   - You set metatables but do not lock them (__metatable field can hide metatable from Lua). For robustness, set a __metatable field on your metatables to a locked value to prevent scripts from changing proxy metatables.
   - Recommendation:
     - In each metatable creation, after setting methods, set a protected __metatable field, e.g., lua_pushstring(L, "locked"); lua_setfield(L, -2, "__metatable");

9) Engine print and asset functions
   - print calls tostring on user args; benign. Just ensure buffer is bounded (you do). Good.
   - asset_load_script and asset_load_atlas are fine. Consider limiting what paths can be loaded or validate resource names strictly to avoid path traversal (you appear to use filesystem_get_resource; ensure it’s safe).

Correctness and safety bugs to fix now
- Casting bug in entity_component_detect_collision_component:
  - Replace:
    EntityComponentCollider *colliderA = (EntityComponentCollider *)a;
    EntityComponentCollider *colliderB = (EntityComponentCollider *)b;
  - With:
    EntityComponentCollider *colliderA = (EntityComponentCollider *)a->data;
    EntityComponentCollider *colliderB = (EntityComponentCollider *)b->data;
- Collision stay callback arguments:
  - For “stay”, pass the other entity consistently:
    entity_run_function_with_args(entity, "entity_collision_stay", 1, arg);
    entity_run_function_with_args(test, "entity_collision_stay", 1, arg_b);
- _get_collision_key thread safety:
  - Replace static char buffer with:
    - Return a heap-allocated string that caller frees, or
    - Store a 128-bit or struct key in the hashmap, or
    - Use thread-local storage if multithreading is planned.

Hardening changes to implement
- Lock metatables of all proxy objects
  - After creating EntityProxyMeta, ComponentsProxyMeta, and component metatables, set __metatable to a string to prevent replacement.
- Restrict base library
  - Do not load base library wholesale. Build a curated _G:
    - Provide only: pairs, ipairs, next, type, tostring, tonumber if needed.
    - Provide math, string as needed.
  - Alternatively, load base but explicitly nil out dangerous functions: load, loadstring, rawset/rawget (optional), setmetatable/getmetatable, coroutine.*. Err on safety side.
- Use a sandboxed environment
  - For each script load, create a fresh environment table env, set its metatable __index to a safe table of whitelisted globals, then setfenv (Lua 5.1) or wrap the chunk with local _ENV = env in Lua 5.2+. You can do this by:
    - lua_newtable(L) for env
    - populate env with print, math, string, your engine APIs
    - load chunk
    - setfenv or push env and set as first upvalue if using 5.2+ compatibility pattern
- Tighten instruction/time limits
  - E.g., max_instruction_count ~ 1e6 per call, LUA_HOOK_FRQ ~ 100.
  - Time limit already 10s; consider per-frame budget if this runs on the hot path (e.g., 10–50 ms per callback).
- Avoid exposing registry-backed tables to Lua scripts unless needed
  - Your entity_list is both global and registry-stored. If scripts don’t need it, remove from globals.
- Normalize function return semantics
  - Ensure calling C functions return meaningful booleans or errors when failures occur.

Smaller quality improvements
- LuaValue:
  - lua_value_get_bool currently returns val->name instead of boolean. Bug:
    - Should return val->value.boolean.
  - lua_value_copy allocation for table items uses sizeof(LuaValue) instead of sizeof(LuaValue*). Should allocate pointer array:
    - memory_manager.malloc(src->value.table.count * sizeof(LuaValue*), MMTAG_LUA);
- Engine logging content and consistency
  - Replace expletives in logs; add categories and structured messages consistently.

Summary
- The core entity/proxy design is sound: clear ownership model, safe pointer extraction checks, and solid Lua proxy wrapping.
- Fix the collider cast and collision-stay argument bug promptly.
- Security-wise, you must harden the Lua sandbox: restrict base libs, lock metatables, reduce instruction limits, and run scripts under a curated environment. These changes meaningfully reduce script abuse surface without sacrificing flexibility.
